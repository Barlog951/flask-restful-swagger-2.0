Add data types decorators (models)

marshal_with: http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fields.html
 - If the returned type has an attributed "marshaled_fields" then use only them to describe the datatype

Support for "dataType": "List[Type]"

In the path, replace <string:todo_id> with just {todo_id}

Deduce parameters from path variables such as /todo/<string:todo_id> ("paramType": "path")
Can this be done also for "paramType": "query"?

Support for multifile declarations

Support for HTML pages
