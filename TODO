marshal_with: http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fields.html
 - If the returned type has an attributed "marshaled_fields" then use only them to describe the datatype
 - Support for resource_fields in the returned type (will work only for return type, not input type)
 - Maybe it's possible to use flask's types, such as flask.String to deduce parameter types

Syntactic sugar and smartness around dataType. Support the following:
 - 'Model'
 - Model
 - 'List[Model]'
 - ['Model']
 - [Model]

Support for HTML pages

Create a pip package and publish it
